# 15112 TermProject: Wake Up
Description: A first-person maze game where players must pay attention to sounds in order to finish the maze. The sound will get louder if the player moved closer to the goal and softer otherwise. 

Background: You, a CMU student, studied late at night for finals week. In case you oversleep, you set up an alarm on your phone. However, it might take a while for you to turn off that alarm.

How to run: The user should run the main.py file in an editor. This project requires cmu_cs3_graphics and pygame to function.

Controller: The player moves forward and backward with 'w', 's'. The player rotates left and right with 'a', 'd'. You can open the maze map with 'e' and request hints by pressing 'h'.

This game was done with raycasting, Prim's algorithm, and the A* search algorithm.
